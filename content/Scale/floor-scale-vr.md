title: Floor-Scale VR
---

Most VR Experiences are either seated or standing. Either you have no body movement, or free movement within the play area.

Underappreciated is "Floor-Scale VR". Inviting the users to sit on the floor, like a child playing with LEGO toys. You have slightly more movement than sitting in a stiff-backed chair, it's comfortable enough to lean significantly or scoot yourself a bit.

Many games that can be played at 'floor scale' can do so because they have been designed to flexibly support seated and standing experiences. Little Cities is a good example of taking a hands-off, flexible approach.

Multiplayer experiences will want to pay attention to how users look when the avatar is in an odd orientation compared to the ground plane.

> I enjoy going into Museum of Other Realities and lying on my back "in" some art, as well as staying seated while flying about in Google Earth VR.
