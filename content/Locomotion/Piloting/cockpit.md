In Implementation, a cockpit is the same as a [room scale vehicle]({{< ref "room-scale-vehicle.md" >}}). In a cockpit, there is no expectation that the user will move around their space. They will likely be seated.

### Motion Sickness
One common approch to battling motion sickness is the "cockpit effect". By visually obscuring the moving environment - particularly the floor and outer periphery - with a relatively non-moving environment, the effects of motion sickness appear reduced. It's like having an always-on vignette, and letting users interact in this space.

## Examples
- Drift Rally
- Microsoft Flight Simulator
- Eve Valkyrie
- Star Wars: Squadrons
