title: Boundary Preview
---

Show an outline of the user's play-space boundary (or some representation of available movement space) when teleporting or moving to a new zone.

Having the user think in terms of "moving the play space" and not "moving themselves" is a more faithful representation to the underlying systems. 

However, it also means exposing the underlying systems to the users, possibly forcing them to think on a 'logistics level' when we would rather they stay engaged in the experience.
If we don't include this preview, and the user does get stuck, this too forces them to reset themselves - and is a much more jarring and unpleasant experience.

For systems that implement granular teleportation, I believe having a toggle-able option for boundary previews to be an excellent addition.
