title: Teleportation Trails
---

Teleportation makes multiplayer experiences difficult. Players have a hard time following their friends as they appear and vanish from sight.

Trails are a way to indicate, over time, the instantaneous movement of the teleporting player. See how the particle effect of falling leaves makes it easy for one player (the point-of-view) to follow another in Museum of Other Realities.
