title: Height Adjustable Tables
---

An experience should be playable by users of all heights and arm lengths. Users may require a shorter or taller than anticipated height for a variety of reasons, including "is sitting in a chair" and "is a child" or "is tall".

I have a friend who is 6 foot 7 inches tall, and life is constantly awkward and difficult for them. Why make VR experiences awkward for them too? Developers should be providing them a respite from the pains of low ceilings, not another place to feel like they don't belong.

Also, when considering your audience, please don't forget that children also exist.

In general, if you are trying to find a "good height" or "good placement" for "most users", you have already failed. Let the user adjust the experience to their own preferences.
